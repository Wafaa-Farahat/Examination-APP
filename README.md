# 📝 Examination System

This project is a desktop-based Examination System developed to apply
advanced DB concepts from our course using SQL Server.  

The system supports two main user roles:
Student and Instructor, each with their own set of features and functionalities.


To enhance usability, the system includes a GUI built with C# (Windows Forms). It supports:

- Student login and exam participation  
- Instructor login, exam generation, and student/course management
