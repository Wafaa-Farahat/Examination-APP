📝 Examination System

This project is a desktop-based Examination System developed to apply advanced database concepts from our course using SQL Server.
The system supports two main user roles: Student and Instructor, each with their own set of features and functionalities.

To enhance usability, the system includes a graphical user interface built with C# (Windows Forms). It supports:

Student login and exam participation

Instructor login, exam generation, and student/course management

💻 Technologies Used

C# (Windows Forms) for building the desktop application

SQL Server for database management

ADO.NET for efficient and secure database interaction

Advanced SQL concepts such as stored procedures, joins, and data validation
